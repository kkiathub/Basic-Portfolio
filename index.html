                <p>Hi, My name is Kanwee, but I go by Jack.  I like VDO games especially the RPG ones, travelling, and horror movies.  I'm not sure what to write about myself, but I'll tell you about my path to become a computer programmer and some places I want to visit before I kick the bucket.</p>
                <p>I have always loved VDO game since I was little.  I always went to the arcade just to watch people played.  When I was in my junior high school, my dad bought me the ATARI.  I was so happy.  I played it over and over, until NES came out.  I was wow with its 8bit graphics.    Unfortunately, my dad wouldn’t buy it for me for financial reason.   Nevertheless, I still got to play it at my friend’s house and sometimes, I just went to the game shop just to watch people played.  I could stand there for hour.   Then I started noticing this certain kind of game.   It got this small character walking around town, venture into the field , and then got into some random battle with monsters by choosing commands on the screen.  It was totally repetitive, and looked tedius.   It’s an RPG game, and it was all in Japanese language which I understand nothing at all.   Any yet, I found myself being drawn to it.   I remember this one time at my favorite shopping mall.  I was just standing in front of this shop watching this person playing this RPG game for hours</p>
                <p>During my high school year, my dad finally bought me NES.   I was so excied!   Now ,I can finally go on my RPG adventure.    There was this famous Japanese RPG game I always want to play.  It’s  Dragon Quest series.   At that time , Dragon Quest 3 was the latest.     I finally got my hand on it.  I was so excited.    I got home, took my console out, put the cassette in, and turn the switch on.    The first thing I saw was just a simple black screen.    Then , this name showed up.    It’s a name of the creater/writer of this game, Yuji Horii.  At that moment , it just hit me.   I want my name on the TV screen after turning the game switch on too!  It was that moment that I want to know more about computer programming.   I would say I followed my path.  I graduated with degrees in computer science.  I became a programmer.  I even got a chance to work at Sony PlayStation.     Unfortunately, I don’t think I can ever make my childhood dream come true.   It requires much bigger effort and ambition, also because of the requirement to have EULA on the screen first thing…duh!    Anyway, I left my programming job in 2008 for the opportunity in restaurant business.     Now, I feel like I need some change again.  I want to get in the web and mobile app development.   I found the UCSD bootcamp.  So far, I got a good feeling about it.  I feel motivated and dedicated.    I can’t wait to see what will happen.</p>
                <p>Now my bucket list,... Oh well, I have enough text to fill up the screen now. Maybe next time.  Thank you for reading!</p>
